/* One automated test for determining the complexity of a piece of text is
## the Flesch-Kincaid grade level test, which assigns a number to a piece
## of text indicating what grade level the computer things is necessary to
## understand that text. This test makes no attempt to actually understand
## the meaning of the text, and instead focuses purely on the complexity of
## the sentences and words used within that text. Specifically, the test
## counts up the total number of words and sentences within the text, along
## with the total number of syllables within each of those words. Given these
## numbers, the grade level score is then computed using the following formula:

############### Grade = C0+C1 * (number of words / num sentences) + ###############
############### C2 * (number of syllables / number of words)       ###############

## Where C0, C1, and C2 are constants chosen as follows: C0 =-15.59, C1 =0.39, C2 =11.8

## In This program we calculate the Flesch-Kincaid grad level for a given textfile.
